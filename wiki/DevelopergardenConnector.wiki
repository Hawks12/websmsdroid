= About Developer Garden =

The Developer Garden is Deutsche Telekom's developer community.

Deutsche Telekom is opening its interfaces, systematically pursuing its goal of open development. The Developer Garden Services allow developers to incorporate telecommunications services such as telephony and text messaging in their applications.

The Developer Garden Services enable users to use the following functions from their own applications:

  * Voice Call: Make phone calls between two subscribers in the mobile and fixed networks
  * Send SMS: Send text messages to the mobile and fixed networks
  * Conference Call: Plan and control conference calls in the mobile and fixed networks with up to 15 participants
  * IP Location: Geographical location of IP addresses


The Developer Garden APIs can be addressed via REST and SOAP. SDKs are available for standard programming languages along with comprehensive documentation. Developers receive personal support with any questions or problems they have via e-mail or Skype and can exchange experiences with other community members in the forum..
