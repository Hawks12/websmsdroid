==What Connector should i use?==

If you own a account for one of the Connectors, use it. You may use your free sms there.

If you don't own an account, the answer differs on your location. At the moment most Connectors are working only for german or austrian people.
Fishtext is specialized on international SMS and should work for most people.

For backup purpose there is a SMS Connector shipped with the main app.
It will send real SMS via your carrier which are billed as normal.

==What is the password for sending a SMS?==

It is the password you set on the Connectors website while registration.

==What is the website of a Connector?==

Please use google. I am pretty sure, google knows the connectors website.

==What is the "prefix"?==

You should enter your international country code here (E.g. +1 for US, +49 for Germany).
