= Introduction =

WebSMS is built modular. This makes it very easy to implement new Connectors.

For WebSMS-2.`*` all Connectors are shipped within the WebSMS.apk file downloaded from here or from android market.

WebSMS-3 is a overall redesign of Connector-handling. It splits all Connectors, but ConnectorSMS, from WebSMS.apk. Each Connector is installed separately.
This makes it even more easy to build your own Connector and even deploy it on your own!

= Details =

To build your own Connector you will have to think about:

 # Where to host the code:
  * Should the code be hold by the [http://github.com/felixb/websms websms git repository]? You may even use this Google Codes site too.
  * Or will you host it on your own? I'd prefer to integrate it in WebSMS-repo. But there is no problem if you want it in your hands.
 # Who should publish it to market:
  * You may publish it on your own.
  * I may publish the Connector for you.

= API =

Well, as you decided where to implement your Connector, you will need the public API of WebSMS's Connector framework.

There is a javadoc run hosted [http://nossl.ub0r.de/~f/websms/doc/ here]. This build from the whole WebSMS project tree.

You may download the ConnectorExample from the git repo, or from download section. Or if you like it hardcore, you can even download the API as single jar-file.

Basically you just need to inherit the [http://nossl.ub0r.de/~f/websms/doc/de/ub0r/android/websms/connector/common/Connector.html Connector] class. But see the example or any other Connector for more details.

With all this, you should be able to build and deploy your own Connector \o/
If something is unclear. Do not hesitate to ask me.

= Architecture =

Here is a sequence diagram showing how the inner communication is working:

[http://websmsdroid.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/sequence.png]

The main app is just an activity with all it's GUI and logic behind.
there is nothing special.
But: It is not able to communicate with any webservice without a Connector.
Each connector is installed as single apk (only the GSM SMS Connector is shipped with WebSMS.apk).
Each connector is living in it's own context.

Communication is done with [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html Broadcasts].
If WebSMS is running the update, bootstrap or send command.
It is sending a broadcast to the specific connector.
The connectors context will spawn here, if it's not alife anymore.
The connector spawns (in most cases) a [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service.html Service], that may run in background without disturbing the user.
This service runs a [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html AsyncTask] to do the real IO work.
At this point the API ends, this is where the doBootstrap(), doUpdate() or doSend() methods are called.

As you might have seen, there are some more methods you could overwrite:
 * initSpec() is run once to initialisize some strings and stuff on spawning.
 * getSpec() is run, everytime it is needed. the connector context will cache the actual instance.

On startup, WebSMS will check, if the number of connectors has changed.
If not: it will use the cached instances of all installed connectors.
If it changed: it will clear the cache and run a broadcast (info request)
to all connectors.
They will spawn, run initSpec() and getSpec() and send back the instance to websms. That's why no IO should be done in either of these methods.
