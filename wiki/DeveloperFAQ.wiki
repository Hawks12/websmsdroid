==I cloned the git repository, but the package de.ub0r.android.websms.connector.common is missing.==

that's right. on linux you may use the buildjar.sh to build it. on any other platform you may copy the .jar from the example connector.

i just don't like bin files in scm. that's the reason.

btw: there are many files symlinked, which have to be replaced on windoze machines too.
